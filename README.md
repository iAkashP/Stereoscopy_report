# Project report LATEX template

This is a LATEX template for writing any report, with support for inline code.

To compile any LATEX file `.tex` you will require a Markdown compiler like [Texstudio](https://www.texstudio.org/).


Clone the project: `git clone https://github.com/iAkashP/Stereoscopy_report` or download it locally.

`Report.tex` is the main file here, open it in compiler, add or remove pages from there if needed.

You have to manually edit `.tex` files present inside `/project` directory and save them all together and compile from  `Report.tex` which will generate a `report.pdf`.


This `report.pdf` is your desired file, take print-out and submit!
