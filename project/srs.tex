\chapter{Features of an image}
\section{Image and Video}
\paragraph{} An image is visual representation of a data. While a video can be defined as a collaboration of images. When a particular \emph{frame} is fixed and captured in different time instances, it merges to create a video.
\section{Pixels}
\paragraph{} Image consists of a matrix of pixels, a tuple which contains values of \textbf{Red, Green and Blue} ranging between $ \textsc{(0-255)} $. The combination of values R,G,B determine the colour of the pixel. When video is considered apart from this three, a fourth variable \emph{time} comes in consideration.
\section{Grayscale and binary}
\paragraph{} To compress an Image, \emph{to reduce the bandwidth}, Image is converted into grayscale, or the form where it loses its R,G,B combination and turns black and white. But the \emph{light intensity} is present there, depending upon the intensity regions can be separated in image. This is not possible in binary, as it is completely hindering the color properties, it is \emph{pure black or white} there is no space for intensity.
\section{Object detection}
\paragraph{} Every object class has its own special features that helps in classifying, having unique color or shape. Using those features the object can be extracted.
